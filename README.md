Web3 Wallet Signatures for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) – Master's Thesis

📖 Master’s Thesis for the Master's Degree in Advanced Telecommunication Technologies (MATT) at Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC)

📌 Overview

This repository contains my Master's thesis on Web3 Wallet Signatures for Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI). The research explores how Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) can enhance privacy, and user control over digital identities while leveraging Ethereum blockchain and EIP-712 Typed Data Signatures for structured and secure messages across blockchain.

This work has been nominated for distinction (Matrícula de Honor) for its contribution to the field of decentralized identity management.

🚀 Key Contributions

✅ Development of a Web3-integrated SSI Wallet to manage identities on the blockchain.

✅ Implementation of DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) for decentralized identity management.

✅ Issuance and verification of Verifiable Credentials (VCs) & Verifiable Presentations (VPs).

✅ Use of Ethereum Typed Data Signatures (EIP-712) for clear and structured signing.

✅ Integration with Sepolia Testnet for DID management using the Ethr-DID method.

✅ Secure authentication flow using SSI principles and cryptographic proofs.

🛠️ Technologies Used

-Blockchain: Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet)

-DID Method: Ethr-DID

-Standards: W3C Verifiable Credentials, EIP-712 Typed Data Signing

-Smart Contracts: Ethr-DID Registry

-Authentication: Login Strategy with Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), Selective Disclosure

🔧 How to Use It

1️⃣ Prerequisites
Before using the system, make sure you have:

-Metamask or any Web3 wallet installed and connected to your browser

-Ethereum test funds (you can get them from a Sepolia Faucet)

2️⃣ Clone the Repository

3️⃣ Install Dependencies

4️⃣ Run the Application


🔮 Future Work

-Adding support for more wallets and/or blockchain networks.
-Enhancing scalability and data storage solutions.
-Improving DID ownership verification mechanisms before issuing credentials.
